# rzozowski

*rzozowski* (ruh-zov-ski) is a Rust crate for reasoning about regular expressions in terms of Brzozowski derivatives.

## What is a Brzozowski derivative?

Let's say we have a regular expression $R$ and a character $c$. The Brzozowski derivative of $R$ with respect to $c$, written as $D_c(R)$, is a new regular expression that constitutes the remainder of $R$ after $c$ has been matched.

For example, if we have the regular expression $R = abc$ and the character $a$, the Brzozowski derivative is $D_a(R) = bc$.

For a more complex example, take the regular expression $R = a\*b$. Because $a$ can be matched multiple times, $D_a(R) = a*b$. If we instead take the derivative with respect to $b$, we get $D_b(R) = \epsilon$ (the empty string), because nothing can be matched after $b$.

## Why is this interesting?

We usually think of a regular expression as a finite automaton and the act of matching a string as the act of transitioning between the automaton's states. Instead, the Brzozowski derivative allows us to skip the finite automaton altogether and determine whether a string matches a regular expression by testing the derivative's nullability (i.e., whether it can match the empty string).

The algorithm is very intuitive (below in pseudocode):

```
R is a regular expression
s is a string

for char c in s:
    if R cannot accept c:
        s does not match R
    else:
        R = D_c(R)

if R is nullable:
    s matches R
else:
    s does not match R
```

## Really? Another regex crate?

I wrote this because I needed to calculate Brzozowski derivatives and couldn't find any satisfactory crates. Once I had implemented derivatives and parsing, it was only 7 more lines to implement matching. Thus, I had a regex crate.

**This crate does not aim to compete with existing regex crates.** For most scenarios, you should probably use a more established crate like [regex](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex) or [fancy-regex](https://github.com/fancy-regex/fancy-regex).

## Usage and features

Install with `cargo add rzozowski` or add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rzozowski = "0.2.0"
```

Usage is very simple. *rzozowski* allows you to:

- Parse a `&str` into a `Regex`
- Convert a `Regex` into a `String`
- Calculate the derivatives of a `Regex`
- Simplify a `Regex`
- Check if a `&str` matches a `Regex`

Here's a simple example:

```rust
use rzozowski::Regex;

fn main() {
    let r = Regex::new("ca+b").unwrap();
    let s = "caab";
    assert!(r.matches(s));

    let derivative = r.derivative('c');
    assert_eq!(derivative, Regex::new("a+b").unwrap());
}
```

*rzozowski* supports the following regex features:

- Literal characters (e.g., `a`)
- Concatenation (e.g., `ab`)
- Alternation (e.g., `a|b`)
- Kleene star (e.g., `a*`)
- Plus (e.g., `a+`)
- Optional (e.g., `a?`)
- Character classes (e.g., `[a-z123]`, `\d`, `\w`, `\s`)
- Counts (e.g., `a{3}`, `a{3,}`, or `a{3,5}`)
- Parentheses (e.g., `(ab)+`)

Note that *rzozowski* currently does not support capture groups, backreferences, or lookaheads. If you need these features, you should use a more established regex crate or submit a pull request to add them here :)

## Speed vs. the standard regex crate

*rzozowski* is dramatically slower than the standard `regex` crate at matching, and faster at parsing.

Benchmarking code can be found in the `benches` directory. I intend to perform more thorough benchmarking soon.
